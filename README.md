# AI-Generated Code Security Analysis
This repository contains the code used to analyze security vulnerabilities in code generated by AI models. The project focuses on evaluating code samples produced by ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.2, and GitHub Copilot across C, JavaScript, and Python 

## Prompts Collection
The repository contains two sets of prompts:
- 40 Generic Prompts per language: Standard programming tasks without explicit security requirements
- 40 Security-Enhanced Prompts per language: The same tasks but with explicit security instructions

These prompts cover common programming scenarios including:
- File handling
- Network operations
- Database interactions
- Authentication systems
- Data processing functions
